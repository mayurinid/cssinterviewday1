        This is a CSS property based on the concept of the flexbox. Flex-direction property can be applied to the parent elements and then the child elements of this parent tag will be placed accordingly.

        The difference is when we apply flex-direction : row, child elements will be placed one after another in the same row (horizontally) and then the row or x-axis will be considered as the main axis, in this case the y-axis will be known as cross axis. 

        On the other hand if we apply flex-direction : column places the child elements in column(vertically) means every child element will be placed one after another in the same column, and then the y-axis will be considered as the main axis and x-axis will be known as cross axis.</pre>

            CSS, we have 3 different ways of writing styles for HTML elements:
            o   Inline
            o   Internal
            o   External
                        
            Inline styling gets applied directly to the element in the style attribute. This styling is having the highest priority among all. But it is not advised to use this styling much in projects. 

            Internal styling gets written in the head tag of the HTML file. It will be written in the style tag. The styling written in style tag will be applicable only in that HTML file.

            External Styling is done by creating a different CSS file with .css extension. This file can be linked to any HTML file wherever the styling is required. The external CSS file can be attached to the HTML file in the head tag in the link tag. This styling is having the least priority but it is the most advised way of writing styling in projects.

            The justify-content property is a sub-property of the Flex-box Module.
            The justify-content property specifies how flex-items are distributed along the main axis of their parent flex-container. If the flex-direction of the parent container is row(default value) then the main axis will be the x-axis. If the flex-direction is a column then the main axis will be the y-axis. This property has 6 different possible values:
            •   	flex-start (default)                         
            •   	flex-end                                         
            •   	center                                            
            •   	space-around                                
            •   	space-between                            
            •   	space-evenly
            •   	stretch

            position: relative
                ●	It is used when we need to position the HTML element relative to its normal position.
                ●	We can set top, right, bottom and left properties that will cause the element to adjust away from the normal position.
            position: absolute
                 ●	An element with position absolute will move according to the position of its parent element.
                 ●	In the absence of the parent element, the HTML element will be placed according to the body tag. In this case if you want to place the element at any position based on the parent element then we need to give the position : relative to parent element and then position : absolute to child element.

            Grid-template-columns property defines how many columns should be there in a grid-container. The number of columns is determined by the number of values defined in the space-separated list. It takes values in px, % and fraction (fr).

            The z-index property determines the stack level of an HTML element. The “stack level” refers to the element’s position on the Z axis (as opposed to the X axis or Y axis). Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index. If the z-index value of any element is positive then that element will be at the top and element having negative value of z-index will be at the bottom.
